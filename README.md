# groundpound
Groundpound is a library that allows developers to create dynamic web pages by creating MVVM models based on any html rendered server-side. The idea of this library came from a desire to be able to use server-side rendering frameworks like ASP.NET MVC while being able to create dynamic web pages with as little redundant Javascript as possible. While other frontend libraries use Javascript objects to create html, _groundpound uses html markup to create Javascript objects_. 

# Installation

Using the library is is as simple as adding groundpound.js to whatever web page you wish to use it on. If you want to generate the final package yourself, simply download Node.js and NPM and run the build script from the package.json file.
```
npm run build
```
